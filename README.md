## User Experience

### User Stories

- First-time visitors quickly clicked the main call to action inside the hero image container. 
- Returning visitors want to access their saved recipes, discover new options, and share recipes with friends and family.

## Design

### Typography

I used Google Fonts to import two main fonts: Lato and Calligraffitti.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato)
- [Calligraffitti](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Calligraffitti?query=callig)

The color palette is vibrant and appetizing, using fresh colors to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
